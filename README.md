Machine learning model to find van der Waals crystals in a set of optical images

Trained machine learning model to classify optical images based on the presence or absence of a clean van der Waals crystal. The model was trained on optical images captured at 10× magnification, with auto white balance properly adjusted prior to acquisition, on Si/SiO₂ (285 nm) substrates.
