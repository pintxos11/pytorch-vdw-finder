Machine learning model to find van der Waals crystals in a set of optical images

Trained ML model to classify optical images based on whether or not they contain a clean van der Waals crystal.
The model has been trained on optical images obtained in X10 magnification, with the auto white balance well balanced prior to acquisition, on Si/SiO2(285nm) substrates.
